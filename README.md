# VRPOptimizer

Welcome to the VRPOptimizer repository! This project is dedicated to tackling the complex and challenging Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), a staple in the field of logistics and supply chain management. Our aim is to develop an efficient and scalable solution that minimizes the total route cost while respecting various constraints such as delivery time windows, vehicle capacities, and customer requirements.

## Repository Contents

- `src/`: This directory contains all the source code for the VRP algorithms implemented in Python. It includes modules for data preprocessing, optimization algorithms, and post-processing of results.

- `data/`: Sample datasets are stored here. They provide the information necessary to test and evaluate the performance of the VRP algorithms, including distances, demands, time windows, and vehicle capacities.

- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks with detailed examples, visualizations, and step-by-step guides on how to use and modify the VRP algorithms.

- `docs/`: Documentation on the methodology, code usage, and background theory. It includes setup instructions, function descriptions, and a detailed explanation of the problem statement.

- `tests/`: Automated tests to ensure the reliability and stability of the algorithms as the codebase evolves.

- `utils/`: Utility scripts and helper functions that support data manipulation, result analysis, and other common tasks.

- `Dockerfile`: For containerizing the application, making it easy to deploy the VRP solution in any environment.

- `requirements.txt`: A list of Python dependencies required to run the code.

- `LICENSE`: The license file detailing how the code can be used by others.

## Features

- **Custom VRP Solver**: A Python-based solver that uses heuristic and metaheuristic approaches to find near-optimal solutions.

- **Scalable and Modular**: Designed to be adaptable to different types of VRP variations including Capacitated VRP, VRP with Time Windows, and more.

- **Visualization**: Tools to visualize routing solutions on maps for easy analysis and reporting.

- **Extensive Documentation**: Everything you need to understand the problem, use the code, and adapt it to your specific needs.

- **Community-Driven**: Contributions are welcome! Whether it's a new feature, bug fix, or an improvement in the documentation, community input is valued.
